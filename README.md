# My Final Python Project: Animated GIF Maker 

Hello! This is my final project submission for the Python course at CODEDEX.

I created a simple Python script (`create_gif.py`) to take two static images and combine them into one continuous, looping animated GIF. This project helped me practice file handling and using external Python libraries.

## 🛠️ How It Works (The Code)

### Prerequisites

You need a working Python 3 installation. Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed. I used them to handle the image files:

```bash
pip install imageio pillow
```
### Running the Script

1.  Put all necessary files (the script and your images) into the same folder.
2.  Open your terminal/command line and navigate to that folder.
3.  Run the script with this command:

```bash
python create_gif.py
